        <h1>Why Is Semantic Code Important?</h1>
        <a href="https://boagworld.com/dev/semantic-code-what-why-how/" target="_blank">Link</a>
        <p>One reason why semantic code is essential is that without explaining what a piece of content is, a computer has no way of knowing. The ability of a machine to understand your content is vital for two main reasons:</p>
        <p>Many visually impaired people rely on speech browsers to read pages back to them. These programs cannot interpret pages very well unless the website clearly explains them. In other words, semantic code aids accessibility</p>
        <p>Search engines need to understand what your content is about to rank you properly on search engines. Therefore, semantic code tends to improve your placement on search engines, as it is easier for them to understand. </p>

        <h1>The Useful SASS Features in a Nutshell — SASS Cheatsheet <a href="https://levelup.gitconnected.com/the-useful-sass-features-in-a-nutshell-sass-cheatsheet-c5767340d43b">link</a></h1>
        <p>You can use the variables feature in SASS to avoid writing and modifying repetitive style properties. Let’s consider you have a specific text colour as #000 to be used in multiple areas across your website’s elements. You can declare a variable in the following manner:</p>       
        <code class="codeLine">$text-color: #000</code>
        <p>To use the property, use the following syntax anywhere in you SCSS file:</p>
        <code class="codeLine">color: $text-color</code>
        <p>You can define the common properties in a separate file and use the import statement to use them in your actual stylesheet.</p>

        <p>Each loops in SASS can be used to iterate through Lists.
            Lists in SASS are basically arrays of some values.
            We can have a <b>list of strings/names</b> and traverse the same.
            The syntax of each loop is little different from for loop.
            It starts with <code class="codeLine">@each</code> keyword and used <code class="codeLine">in</code> instead of <b>through</b>.</p>

        <h1>Sleep Problems -- the Basics Understanding Sleep Problems -- The Basics</h1>
        <h2>Basics</h2>
        <p>Light and exercise "reset" the clock and can move it forward or backward. Abnormalities related to this clock are called circadian rhythm disorders ("circa" means "about," and "dies" means "day").<br>
            Circadian rhythm disorders include jet lag, adjustments to shift work, delayed sleep phase syndrome (you fall asleep and wake up too late), and advanced sleep phase syndrome (you fall asleep and wake up too early). 
        </p>
        <h2>Insomnia </h2>
        <p>People who have insomnia don't feel as if they get enough sleep at night. They may have trouble falling asleep or may wake up frequently during the night or early in the morning. 
            <br>
            Insomnia has many possible causes, including stress, anxiety, depression, poor sleep habits, circadian rhythm disorders (such as jet lag), and taking certain medications.
        </p>
        <h2>Snoring </h2>
        <p>
            Snoring can be a problem simply because of the noise it causes. It may also be a marker of a more serious sleep problem called sleep apnea.
        </p>
        <h2>Sleep Apnea </h2>
        <p>Sleep apnea occurs when the upper airway becomes completely or partially blocked, interrupting regular breathing for short periods of time -- which then wakes you up. It can cause severe daytime sleepiness. If left untreated, severe sleep apnea may be associated with high blood pressure and the risk of stroke and heart attack. </p>
        <h2>Pregnancy and Sleep </h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Women often experience sleepless nights and daytime fatigue in the first and third trimesters of their pregnancy. During the first trimester, frequent trips to the bathroom and morning sickness may disrupt sleep.  </li>
            <li>Later in pregnancy, vivid dreams and physical discomfort may prevent deep sleep. After delivery, the new baby's care or the mother's postpartum depression may interrupt sleep. </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Narcolepsy </h2>
        <p>Narcolepsy is a brain disorder that causes excessive daytime sleepiness. There is sometimes a genetic component, but most patients have no family history of the problem. </p>
        <h2>Restless Legs Syndrome </h2>
        <p>In people who have restless legs syndrome, discomfort in the legs and feet peaks during the evening and night. They feel an urge to move their legs and feet to get temporary relief, often with excessive, rhythmic, or cyclic leg movements during sleep. </p>
        <h2>Nightmares </h2>
        <p>Nightmares are frightening dreams that arise during REM sleep. </p>
        <h2>Night Terrors and Sleepwalking </h2>
        <p>
            Both night terrors and sleepwalking arise during NREM sleep and occur most often in children between the ages of 3 and 5 years old. A night terror can be dramatic: Your child may wake up screaming, but unable to explain the fear. Sometimes children who have night terrors remember a frightening image, but often they remember nothing. Night terrors are often more frightening for parents than for their child.
            <br>Sleepwalkers can perform a range of activities -- some potentially dangerous, like leaving the house -- while they continue to sleep. 
        </p>
        <h2>What Causes Sleep Disorders? </h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Insomnia
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Insomnia may be temporary and stem from a simple cause, such as jet lag.  </li>
                    <li>Short-term insomnia may also be caused by an illness, a stressful event, or drinking too much coffee, for example. </li>
                    <li>Long-term insomnia may be caused by stress, depression, or anxiety. </li>
                    <li>People can also become conditioned to insomnia: They associate bedtime with difficulty. </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Snoring and Sleep Apnea: When you fall asleep, many muscles in your body relax. If muscles in the throat relax too much, your breathing may be blocked and you may snore. </li>
            <li>Pregnancy and Sleep:<br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Fatigue during the first trimester of pregnancy is likely caused by changing levels of hormones, such as progesterone.  </li>
                    <li>Toward the end of pregnancy, some women find it difficult to sleep because of the uncomfortable size of their abdomen.  </li>
                    <li>Some women are too excited, anxious, or worried about becoming mothers to sleep well.  </li>
                    <li>Other women who are pregnant complain that vivid dreams prevent them from getting restful sleep. Sleep apnea, especially if it's severe and causes your blood oxygen level to drop during sleep, is a risk to the fetus. </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Narcolepsy: The cause of narcolepsy is not clear. </li>
            <li>Nightmares and Night Terrors: Nightmares can be triggered by a frightening or stressful event, a fever or illness, or use of some medications or alcohol. </li>
        </ol>
        <h1>How to Resolve a Lack of Deep Sleep </h1>
        <h2>What Is Deep Sleep? </h2>
        <p>Deep sleep is slow-wave sleep. It gets this name from the slow brain waves, called delta waves, that the brain produces during this time. </p>
        <h2>How Much Deep Sleep Do You Need? </h2>
        <p>People of different ages spend different amounts of time in deep sleep. Children spend more time in deep sleep than adults.  </p>
        <ul>
            <li>School-aged kids and teens need to spend 20-25% of their sleep time in deep sleep.</li>
            <li>Adults should spend about 16-20% of their sleep time in deep sleep.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Men tend to have a much sharper decrease in deep sleep than women as they age. </p>
